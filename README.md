#  Trader Behavior Insights â€“ Junior Data Scientist Assignment

This project explores the relationship between **Bitcoin market sentiment** (Fear vs Greed Index) and **trader behavior** using historical data from Hyperliquid.

##  Objective

To analyze how market sentiment influences:

-  Trader profitability (`closed_pnl`)
-  Risk-taking behavior (`start_position` used as a proxy for missing `leverage`)
-  Trading patterns across different sentiment phases (Fear vs Greed)

### 1. Fear & Greed Sentiment Index
- Columns: `Date`, `Classification` (Fear or Greed)
